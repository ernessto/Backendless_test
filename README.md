1. Install `node.js`.
2. Open `Command line` and go to project folder.
3. Run `npm install` or `yarn` to install all modules.
4. Run `npm run start` or `yarn start` to run project.

Note: tabs.json i upload on mocky.io.
I slightly changed the structure, here's how it looks:
`[
  {"id": "dummyTable","title":"Dummy Table","order":1,"path":"./components/DummyTable"},
  {"id": "dummyChart","title":"Dummy Chart","order":2,"path":"./components/DummyChart"},
  {"id": "dummyList","title":"Dummy List","order":0,"path":"./components/DummyList"}
]`
